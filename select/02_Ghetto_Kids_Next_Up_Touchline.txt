Find me elokishini with my bros
Even though moving out is our life goals
Don't concern yourself with a typo
Ghetto kids can spell poverty with their eyes closed
Reach under the bed to find the shoes that I just don't wanna wear
Kodwa aw'na choice cause there is no other pair
Feel [?] isinkwa and share
My labels want a slice of me, I'm kasi born and bred
A shoe box is for saving up
A good job doesn't pay enough
My music on Spotify and you wouldn't take my spot if I gave it up
New wave, and you might drown from streaming my latest stuff
Bath' u charma-boy but he still struggles with lady luck
Gotta hit up Limpopo to brush my Sepedi up
Stand up dude I only sit down once I have said enough
Tendency of falling but a master at getting up
When it rains it pours, life gives swimming lessons only in the storm
Mpintji yami is picking sides, his parents got divorced
Only thing consistent is this brotherhood, of course

Bathi skorokoro but I bought it cash
As long as it can take me to the stu' and back
It's a lil' step up from my Daddy's Tazz
At least I took a break from taxi maths
Be sqhaqhazela si-light i-primus stove
Now I heat up the room with my rhymes and flows
Competition yami ithol' uk'thula when my mic is off
Bath' u-Touch umshini ungaw'cimi; the game's life support
Ekasi we do not make time to read
We still think depression is a white disease
That's why s'bhema, sphuze kuze kuse
Trying to put our minds at ease, with the hopes of finding peace
Convoy yo mcwabo every Saturday
K'shaywa ma-hazards, cemetery's packed again
The policy only covers the casket and the tent
All these food to feed the community is the fam's expense
Angazi, imali ayikho, maar sthand' isiko
Apartheid yaphela sding' i financial freedom
Our parents never went to school because it was illegal
Babheke ukuthi thina s'geleze siyo change simo
Born under pressure because of my complexion
Slikour showed me you can make it out of Skwatta Kamp, son
The game was a boy band but there's one direction
Phezulu ntwana, the ghetto kids are next up
